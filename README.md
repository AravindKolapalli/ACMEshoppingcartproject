Project ACME Shopping Cart

First, this shopping cart idea clearly needs development if there are particular circumstances. 

Imagine that you are both an administrator and a customer.
Products in the catalog can only be added, updated, or deleted by admins.
Similarly, administrators are the only ones who may add news.
The software receives a list of goods.
There may be a name, description, price, etc. for the goods.

This enables the CUSTOMER role's shopping cart capabilities. Here, customers may add items from the catalog to their shopping carts.
One consumer may place several orders.
A checkout order summary can be necessary. It could include details about the things, the price, etc.

Additional work might advance in this manner.
If we have 5000 goods in our catalog, we could also want a filtering option in the API.
The filter may be used for free searches on product names.
We could think about adding pagination capabilities to the API.

Please be aware before entering that several validations and edge situations may be lacking.
The project's major focus is on the H2 database and SpringBoot JPA; further information is included in the applications.attributes file
